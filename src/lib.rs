//! # Movetex: Non-blocking Mutex Alternative for Complex Data
//!
//! Movetex provides a non-blocking, atomic-based synchronization primitive in Rust, enabling multiple readers or a single writer to access complex data structures safely and efficiently. Unlike a standard `Mutex`, Movetex performs atomic pointer swaps, making it suitable for advanced scenarios where atomic operations are needed not only for basic types but also for complex data structures.
//!
//! ## Key Features
//!
//! - **Atomic Operations for Complex Data**: Movetex uses two `AtomicPtr` pointers, allowing atomic read/write access for non-trivial data types without blocking readers.
//! - **Multiple Readers, Single Writer**: Allows multiple readers simultaneously, while only one writer can have access at a time, without reader blocking.
//! - **Conditional Write Handling**: `write` returns a `bool` to indicate if the write lock was acquired, giving you control over what to do if a write isnâ€™t immediately possible.
//!   - For multithreaded scenarios, you can retry or pause.
//!   - In async contexts, yield the current green thread to improve efficiency.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! use movetex::Movetex;
//! use std::sync::Arc;
//!
//! let data = Arc::new(Movetex::new(String::from("Initial Data")));
//!
//! let read_value = data.read();
//! println!("Current value: {}", read_value);
//!
//! // Attempt writing
//! if data.write(|val| *val = String::from("Updated Data")) {
//!     println!("Write successful.");
//! } else {
//!     println!("Write attempt failed; handle retry or yield here.");
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This example shows how Movetex ensures atomicity for complex data reads/writes, with controlled handling for write contention.

/// Movetex: A lock-free synchronization primitive for concurrent data access
///
/// `Movetex<T>` enables safe, non-blocking, atomic read and write access to complex data types
/// with multiple readers and a single writer. Internally, it uses two `AtomicPtr` fields to allow
/// atomic pointer-based synchronization, extending atomic operations to complex data types beyond
/// basic atomic primitives.
///
/// Readers can access data simultaneously without blocking, and only one writer is permitted at
/// a time. If a write attempt cannot acquire access, it returns `false`, allowing users to decide
/// how to handle contention. This could mean retrying, blocking, or yielding in async contexts.
///
/// ### Usage Example:
/// ```rust
/// use movetex::Movetex;
/// use std::sync::Arc;
/// use std::thread;
///
/// let movetex = Arc::new(Movetex::new("Initial value".to_string()));
///
/// thread::scope(|s| {
///     // Spawn multiple readers
///     for _ in 0..5 {
///         let m = Arc::clone(&movetex);
///         s.spawn(move || {
///             let value = m.read();
///             println!("Read value: {}", *value);
///         });
///     }
///
///     // Single writer attempting to modify the data
///     let m = Arc::clone(&movetex);
///     s.spawn(move || {
///         if m.write(|data| *data = "Updated value".to_string()) {
///             println!("Write succeeded");
///         } else {
///             // sleep, retry, or yield here
///         }
///     });
/// });
/// ```
///
/// The `write` method returns `false` if it cannot acquire access, so you can choose to handle
/// this case by blocking, retrying, or yielding if in an async context. Further explanations of
/// the `write` and `swap` mechanisms, and the cloning rationale in `write`, are provided in the
/// detailed documentation.
